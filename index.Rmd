Hi! I'm Elizabeth Hance and I love data.  After getting my Master's degree in computational mathematics, I joined the team at OSU focused on studying student academic success.  Since graduating, I've expanded my knowledge of the data science world through my job and independent study.  This site serves as a collection of some of the things I have learned.  Feel free to reach out to my at my contact info below.
