From Microsoft Azure: cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ('the cloud') to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

* Types of cloud deployment: private (own hardware, can provide best security), public (using hardware/software you don't own, can be less secure), hybrid
